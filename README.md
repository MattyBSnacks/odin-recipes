The Recipes project will reinforce html basics such as creating boilerplates, hyperlinks, lists, embeding images, and everything else taught thus far relating to html by creating a website for tasty food recipies. The project reinforces the importance of git and github by giving the student a real project to work through and track their progress using commit messages. File structure will also be reinforced as it's an important topic when it comes to scaling a project.
